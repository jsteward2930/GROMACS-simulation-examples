GROMACS Simulation Repository

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, simulation files, and analysis tools for molecular dynamics simulations conducted using GROMACS. These resources are primarily aimed at educational and demonstration purposes, particularly for sharing simulation workflows and results.

Repository Contents

- Jupyter Notebooks: Step-by-step guides and scripts for running and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations.
- PDB Files: Protein Data Bank files that contain the 3D structures of proteins used in the simulations.
- GRO Files: GROMACS structure files, detailing the system setup for simulations.
- ITP Files: Include Topology files used by GROMACS for defining non-standard molecules.
- MDP Files: Molecular Dynamics Parameter files that specify the simulation parameters.
- NVT Files: Files related to the canonical ensemble (constant Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature) simulations.
- NDP Files: Typically, these should refer to simulation setup files; ensure correct file type specifications as needed.
- XTC Files: Compressed trajectory files that store the coordinates of the atoms throughout the simulation.

Tools Used

- GROMACS: Open-source software for high-performance molecular dynamics, primarily designed for biochemical molecules.
- MDAnalysis: A Python library that simplifies the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories and protein structures. Used in the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analysis.
